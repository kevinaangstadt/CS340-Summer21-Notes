    "To emphasize the influence and functionality of software in our lives, listed below are areas where a software maintenance error caused drastic consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Power -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003\">Northeast blackout of '03</a>: A **race condition** (two pieces of code running simultaneously, producing a different result depending on the order) contributed to a failing alarm system, sparking a blackout affecting the northeastern and north midwestern areas of the U.S., as well as Ontario.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Defense -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#Failure_at_Dhahran\">Patriot Missile System error</a>: An error created through poor planning. The internal clock of the system was measuring tenths of a second, but the developers multiplied this value by ten. However, they were also using a 24-bit register, causing the missile to miss its target, killing many people.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Driving -> <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration#Sudden_acceleration_in_Toyota_vehicles\">Bookout v. Toyota Motor Company </a>: A stack overflow in a few cars' software essentially disabled users from controlling their acceleration seamlessly. We can attribute this error to poor planning and/or not ensuring that redundancy was avoided in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Finance/Privacy -> <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach\">Equifax data breach</a>: In 2017, Equifax, which managed their systems primarily  on Apache Struts, ran into a bug which likely could have been avoided by upgrading said software. Subsequently, privacy of the company and their clients was breached (i.e. passwords were found in ASCI text files).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Health Care -> <a href = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthCare.gov#Concerns_about_the_website\"> Healthcare.gov</a>\n",
