    "- Power -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003#Causes\">Northeast Blackout of 2003</a>: A **race condition** (an event in which two pieces of code run simultaneously, producing different results depending on the order) caused an alarm system failure, prompting a blackout in the northeastern and north midwestern US, as well as Ontario, Canada.\n",
    "- Defense -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot#Failure_at_Dhahran\">Patriot Missile System error</a>: A clock system calculating velocity incorrectly. It was mesuring in tenths of a second, so the devs multiplied that value by ten to get a measurement in seconds. However, they were using a 24-bit register, causing the missile to miss its target by a few hundred meters, killing many people.\n",
    "- Driving -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_unintended_acceleration#Sudden_acceleration_in_Toyota_vehicles\">Bookout v. Toyota Motor Company</a>: A software bug in a few vehicles (including Audi and Toyota) essentially disabled control over acceleration spontaneously, leading to a few fatal crashes.\n",
    "- Finance/privacy -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach/a\">Equifax data breach</a>: Equifax, a credit reporting institution, was using an outdated version of software called Apache Struts. A security patch was released, but the company's cilents had their privacy breach (i.e. investigation found passwords in standard ASCI text files).\n",
    "- Health Care -> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HealthCare.gov#Concerns_about_the_website\">HeathCare.gov</a>\n",
